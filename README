Emulator of the MIPS32 4Kc Processor in Java
Author: Humberto Silva Naves

====================
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
====================

In order to compile just run "ant main" on the main folder.
If you are under linux you will probably need the MIPS toolchain to compile the files in the "asm" folder 


====================
HOW TO RUN
====================

Type "ant run" on the same folder (You probably need the vmlinux file and the initrd file which I didn't add to the repository yet!)


Enjoy!
