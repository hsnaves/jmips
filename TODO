Todo:
- Provide a minimal linux distro in order to test (on its way)
- Implement more exhaustive tests
- Implement dynamic recompilation
- Implement a network device
- Implement a real time clock device
- Implement a storage/block device (almost complete)
- Refactor the SwingTTY class (it's horrible!)
